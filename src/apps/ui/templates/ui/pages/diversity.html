                    Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful environment that welcomes participation from people
                    of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientations. The
                    Battlesnake community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working
                    to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever
                    you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

                    We're actively seeking to increase the diversity of our users, event attendees, and sponsors. This
                    is and will continue to be an ongoing process.
