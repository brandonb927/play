                    This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is
                    representing the project or its community.

                    The Battlesnake community welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This
                    includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
                    immigration status, socio-economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender
                    identity, and gender expression, age, size, family status, political beliefs, religion, and mental

                <p class="card-text">
                    While Battlesnake is inherently competitive, it is also deeply rooted in community, collaboration,
                    and cooperation. Always consider the impact of your decisions and actions on fellow participants.
                    Remember that Battlesnake is a fun, inclusive game, and that means working with and helping
                    individuals from a variety of different backgrounds, representing a full range of skill levels.

                <p class="card-text lead">
                    Be respectful.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Treat everyone you encounter with courtesy and respect. We acknowledge that disagreements happen but
                    they must never turn into any form of personal attack. A productive community is one where everyone
                    feels safe and comfortable.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text lead">
                    Be thoughtful with the words you choose.

                <p class="card-text">
                    We are a community of students and professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Speak to
                    and about others with kindness. Derogatory language of any kind will not be tolerated.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text lead">
                    Be constructive and flexible.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Battlesnake is no exception. It is
                    important that we resolve conflict constructively. Remember that different people have different
                    perspectives and an alternate viewpoint isnâ€™t necessarily wrong. Instead, focus on working toward
                    compromise, so we can resolve issues cooperatively and learn from each other.
